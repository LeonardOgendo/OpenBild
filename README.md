## OpenBild

**OpenBild** is a developer collaboration platform where developers can sign up (via email/password or GitHub OAuth), post their projects, explore other developers' projects, and send collaboration requests. When a developer shows interest in a project, they can drop a message to the project owner, which triggers an email notification for seamless connection and collaboration.
